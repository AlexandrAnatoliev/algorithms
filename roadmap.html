Asymptotic analysis of algorithms

First of all, it is necessary to be understood to determine the complexity of the algorithm. Which algorithm will be
faster in a particular situation. Get the complexity of the algorithms:

Upper grade (Oh-larth);
average assessment (theta);

Low rating (Î© omega).

Basic Data Structures

After that, we understand how we understand how each structure work, how it works. We note for ourselves as their pros
and cons, area of application.
